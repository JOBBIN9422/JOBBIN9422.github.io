             <h2>Summary</h2>
             <h3>Overview</h3>
             <p>This project showcases several pathfinding algorithms which I implemented
                for the sake of automating a game of <em>Snake</em>. I wrote the game in
                C++ using the FLTK library for graphics and user input. The following 
                pathfinding algorithms are included:</p>

                <ul>
                  <li>A-Star</li>
                  <li>Greedy Best-First Search</li>
                  <li>Breadth-First Search</li>
                  <li>Depth-First Search</li>
                </ul>

             <h3>Legend</h3>
             <p>Each algorithm's search is drawn on the game field with the following color
                scheme:</p>

                <ul>
                  <li><strong><font color='blue'>Blue: </font></strong>Nodes which have already been explored (closed set).</li>
                  <li><strong><font color='cyan'>Cyan: </font></strong>Nodes which are currently being explored (frontier/open set).</li>
                  <li><strong><font color='red'>Red: </font></strong>The path selected by the algorithm.</li>
                </ul>

             <h3>Algorithms</h3>

             <figure>
                <img src='images/astar.gif'/>
                <figcaption>The <strong>A-Star algorithm</strong> uses a heuristic function to evaluate nodes 
                            and prioritize them based on their goal distance and distance from the starting node.</figcaption>
             </figure>

             <figure>
                <img src='images/bfs.gif'/>
                <figcaption><strong>Breadth-first search</strong> radiates outward in all four directions - it evaluates all of a given node's
                            neighbors before proceeding outwards. This has heavy performance implications due to its
                            poor space complexity.</figcaption>
             </figure>

             <figure>
                <img src='images/greedy.gif'/>
                <figcaption><strong>Greedy best-first search</strong> works in the same manner as A-Star
                            but with a different heuristic which only prioritizes nodes by their
                            distance to the goal node. This can achieve similar results while exploring
                            fewer nodes.</figcaption>
             </figure>

             <figure>
                <img src='images/dfs.gif'/>
                <figcaption><strong>Depth-first search</strong> was included mostly as a curiosity since
                            it's ill-suited to this sort of problem. DFS expands all nodes in a given
                            direction from the current node before choosing another path. For this reason,
                            it explores a lot of unnecessary nodes before finding the goal.</figcaption>
             </figure>

             <h3>Continuous Search</h3>
             <p>After testing each algorithm for a while, I noticed that paths became more and more
                convoluted as the snake grew in length. This is because the snake's body becomes 
                a moving obstacle for the algorithm to path around - the path it initially finds
                may become suboptimal as the snake's body moves out of the way. </p>
                
             <p>To solve this issue,
                I added the option of re-running the path search on each frame. This allows the snake to
                re-evaluate its path as its body segments move, leading to better (shorter) paths
                at the expense of a lot of extra computation.</p>

             <figure>
                <img src='images/greedy-repeat.gif'/>
                <figcaption>Repeated searching allows Greedy BFS to 'tighten' its original path around the snake's tail segments.</figcaption>
             </figure>
              
             <h3>Statistics</h3>
             <p>The program tracks various statistics about each run in order to allow for 
                easy comparison of the different algorithms. This gives a better idea about
                the time and space complexity of each search and allows you to weigh the
                pros and cons of different shortest-path algorithms.</p>

                <figcaption>Statistics collected at the end of each run.</figcaption>

             <h2>Compiling & Running</h2>
             <p>If you're using a Linux-based OS, check out the <a href='https://github.com/JOBBIN9422/SnakeAI'>repository</a>
                and use the included makefile. For Windows, follow <a href='https://bumpyroadtocode.com/2017/08/05/how-to-install-and-use-fltk-1-3-4-in-visual-studio-2017-complete-guide/'>these</a>
                directions with the source code from the repository.</p>

             <img src='images/options.png'/>

             <p>The above options work as follows:</p>
             <ul>
               <li><strong>Time Step (Seconds): </strong>The length of each frame in seconds (default 0.05).</li>
               <li><strong>Screen Width (px): </strong>The screen width in pixels (default 800).</li>
               <li><strong>Screen Height (px): </strong>The screen height in pixels (default 600).</li>
               <li><strong>Search Algorithm: </strong>The pathfinding algorithm used to guide the snake (default A-Star).</li>
               <li><strong>Repeat Search on Each Frame: </strong>Toggles whether or not to re-evaluate the snake's path on each frame.</li>
             </ul>
             <h2>Remarks</h2>
             <p>I wrote this at a time when FLTK was the only graphical software I knew 
                how to develop in. This library is not a great choice for this sort of 
                work since it's actually a GUI toolkit (the snake segments are actually
                styled UI boxes!). A more relevant library such
                as SDL2 would have been a more reasonable pick. Hindsight is 20-20!</p>
