             <h2>Summary</h2>
             <p>This is a basic <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CHIP-8'>CHIP-8</a>
                emulator implemented in C#. The frontend was designed using WinForms
                 (gross, I know). It has several features which allow you to inspect
                the contents of the machine as it runs:</p>
                <ul>
                  <li>A debug window which displays the following:
                    <ul>
                      <li>Register contents</li>
                      <li>Stack contents and stack pointer location</li>
                      <li>Timer states</li>
                      <li>Program counter address</li>
                    </ul>
                  </li>
                  <li>A window which displays the currently executing instruction
                      and its address.</li>
                  <li>A button which allows the user to view an arbitary byte of
                      memory at a given address.</li>
                  <li>Variable clock speed.</li>
                </ul>
             <h2>Compiling &amp; Running</h2>
             <ol>
               <li>Create a WinForms project in Visual Studio.</li>
               <li>Add the source code from the <a href='https://github.com/JOBBIN9422/ChocolateCHIP'>repository</a> to your
                   project.</li>
               <li>Build the project and load some <a href='https://github.com/JOBBIN9422/ChocolateCHIP/tree/master/emuDebug/games/roms'>ROMs</a>.</li>
             </ol>

             <h2>Controls</h2>
             <p>The leftmost 16 keys of the keyboard (1 to 4, Q to R, A to F, and Z to V)
                act as the keypad of the CHIP-8. Different games use somewhat
                arbitrary bindings for the keypad.</p>

             <h2>Remarks</h2>
             <p>Interestingly, CHIP-8 never had native hardware designed for it - it
             was developed as an interpreted language run on a simple virtual machine.
             This allowed it to be run on early 8-bit computers which didn't have
             many games written for them at the time.</p>
            
             <p>This design choice gives the CHIP-8 interpreter some unique quirks
                and leads to some minor differences between implentations of the
                interpeter. Firstly, many different games expect wildly different
                clock speeds for the virtual CPU. I assume this is due to the many
                decades worth of interpreters written for all sorts of different
                hardware (everything from 8-bit computers to calculators). This 
                made having an adjustable clock speed a necessity for testing 
                different games on the emulator.</p>

             <p>Secondly, different interpreters handle the CHIP-8's draw code
                differently for pixels which are outside of the screen bounds.
                Some interpreters treat out-of-bounds pixels as no-ops (nothing happens
                for these pixels). Other interpreters (mine included) perform
                modulo operations on OOB pixels (this wraps them around to the
                other side of the screen). Either setting can break some games
                depending on which behavior they expect. For example, graphics
                wrapping in the BLITZ ROM causes an unintended game over due to
                the columns of pixels wrapping from the bottom edge to the top
                of the screen.</p>
