## Porting My Website to Jekyll
When I first wrote this website back in early 2019 or so, I didn't know much about webpages or web development and wrote every page in static HTML from a template page that I copy-pasted any time I wanted to add new content. 
Clearly, that isn't really maintainable since I'd have to make any layout changes across every page of my website manually. 

Fast-forward to today, and that bit about not knowing anything about web dev is still true, but I decided to template-ize my website to make the layout more maintainable as I add/change things. Enter [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/): a static site generator
that does pretty much exactly what I need and is also hosted on GitHub pages, which I'm using to host this site. 

Thankfully, Jekyll's official docs include [a page](https://jekyllrb.com/tutorials/convert-site-to-jekyll/) that details how to convert an existing website to use Jekyll. I was able to convert my old HTML page template into a Jekyll-friendly version, and
it includes support for blog-like posts out of the box, so I figured I'd write about it here.
